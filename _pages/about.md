I am currently pursuing a PhD in Economics at Sciences Po (Paris), under the supervision of [Roberto Galbiati](https://sites.google.com/view/galbiatir1/).

My primary research interest is understanding whether redistribution can change environmental policy support. I am working on a project to understand how place-based policies in coal communities in Appalachia (United States) change perceptions on the trade-off between jobs and the environment.

My other research interests include the design and evaluation of environmental policies, including policies for the transition to a circular economy, as well as political economics and wealth inequality.

Previously, I worked as a Young Associate and later as Research Associate at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), where I contributed to a number of projects, such as the development of national circular economy strategies of Hungary and Slovakia, chapters in the Global Plastics Outlook (2022), and review papers on green fiscal stimulus, among others.

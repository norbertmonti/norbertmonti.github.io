My name is Norbert Monti, and I am currently a PhD candidate in Economics at Sciences Po (Paris), under the supervision of Roberto Galbiati.

My primary research interest is understanding whether redistribution can change environmental policy support. I am currently working on a project to understand how place-based policies in coal communities in Appalachia (United States) change perceptions' of trade-off between jobs and the environment.

My other research interests include the design and evaluation of environmental policy, as well as studying policies for the transition to a circular economy.

Previously, I worked as a Young Associate and later as Research Associate the the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), where I worked on a number of projects, such as chapters in the Global Plastics Outlook, contributed to the national circular economy strategies of Hungary and Slovakia, and wrote reviews on green fiscal stimulus.
